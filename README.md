# 🩺 DRISHTI – Diabetic Retinopathy Detection using Hybrid Deep Learning

## 📌 Overview
DRISHTI is an AI-powered system designed to detect and classify **Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)** from retinal fundus images using a **hybrid deep learning model (CNN + Vision Transformer)**.

The system enables **early detection**, reduces dependency on specialists, and supports **scalable healthcare solutions**, especially in rural areas.
